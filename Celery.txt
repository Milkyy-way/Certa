Celery

helps in creating scalable application
can create efficient application by using it


Celery is kind of task which uses the DS queue---> 1st in 1st out
its a queue
if we have some heavy task and we dont want to execute in django process and want to execute task in seperate flow which will not affect our main application then we can use celery.
it can be crown job or preodic schedular
Eg if i want to manage bday for employe then i ca set a task and celery will take care of it


It wont work alone it will use redis or rabbit MQ which will work faster then sql. and schedule its task.
