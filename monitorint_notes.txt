As per topics I have been given I should know how to navigate in 
	1) Datadog
	2) Sentry
	3) AWS Cloudwatch
	4) Dashboard for SQS RDS ECS

	1) Datadog - I checked that where logs are been monitored
		a.  where we can do synthetic monitoring,
		b.  dashboard creation with different visualization like where I can check all my dashboard how I can create new dashboard , 
		c. how I can create alert and in datadog it is present under monitoring section. Typese of monitoring like host,live process, network, logs, RUM(real user monitoring) and many other ---custom check, events, composite(a+b=C).
		Detection methods---
		Threshold 
		Change
		Anomaly--certyain behaviour at certain time
		forcast
		d.  What kind of logs we can see like server log or access log.  What are the fields we can differenciate to  monitor logs fastly.
	2) (see later)Sentry--- Use for all platform and all language to intrigate to capture any bug and send the details in our dashboard
	3) AWS Cloudwatch--
		Collect 
		Monitor
		Act
		Analyse
		Dashboard(multiple visualization)
		Alarms with 3 things alarm, insufficient, ok
		Matrix(important---> lambda and different functions to monitor apis)
		Log
		Insights(customize the query)
		events
		Performance Monitoring
		Synthatic Monitoring
	4) Seen the Dashboard for SQS- itâ€™s a amazon simple queue service which allow the application to queue message that are generated by one compound and used by another compound
	Like Message come from web to SQS and then it will send to app
	Two types of queue
	Standard and FIFO
	Standard queue insure that message are generally delivered in same order as they are sent
	FIFO 
	Standards has unlimited throughput but fico has limited throughput
	5) RDS - relational database- manage relational DB it make setup easy operate and scale.
	 7 engins(mysql,oracle,mongo etc) are provided 
	Features of RDS- scalibality, security, cost efective, duarbility.
