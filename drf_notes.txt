Normal django framework
Django server<----------->website<----------->customer

DRF is a library which is used for making APIs

Serializer---View---Output
JSON--> key value type data

Thunder client is used for testing its same as postman

----------------------------------------------------
After installing rest frame work package through pip

Go to settings and add rest_framework in installed apps

Creaye an new folder in root directory and create a file __init__ file
Create views--> import response class, it will take any python/serialized data and render it into jeson data
			Import decorator also
			Now create a method and put @anotation for "get/post etc"
Create URL ---> import path
		     import a views
		Give the path urlpatterns = [ path('',views.getData)],
Jump to root dir and in URLs provide own created folder url 



------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is for database
Create another folder under root folder 
Register that new folder in main project setting.py

Go inside the model of newly created file add the method ---> do makemigration then apply the migration by migrate command
In Shell command type python manage.py shellâ€¦it will open a intractive consol for writing SQL

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside our 1st created folder make a new file by the name serializer.py

This serializer will convert the item object inside model of 2nd file into jason body so that response object can understand which we created in 1st folder
Import the serializer from rest_framework and then import the idem model from the 2nd folder(base app)

Create serilizer class 

-------------------------------
 inside VIEW of 1st folder import item serlizer which we will create in 2nd  folder model file

-----------------------------
In view we can create other methods(post/put etc) and then in url we can set the URL
